            <p>
                Was any of it true? <br>
                Gazing at me starry-eyed <br>
                In your Jehovah's Witness suit <br>
                Who the fuck was that guy? <br>
                You tried to buy some pills <br>
                From a friend of friends of mine <br>
                They just ghosted you <br>
                Now you know what it feels like
            </p>
            <p>
                And I don't even want you back, I just want to know <br>
                If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal <br>
                And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give <br>
                A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
            </p>
            <p>
                You hung me on your wall <br>
                Stabbed me with your push pins <br>
                In public, showed me off <br>
                Then sank in stoned oblivion <br>
                'Cause once your queen had come <br>
                You'd treat her like an also-ran <br>
                You didn't measure up <br>
                In any measure of a man
            </p>
            <p>
                And I don't even want you back, I just want to know <br>
                If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal <br>
                And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give <br>
                A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
            </p>
            <p>
                Were you sent by someone <br>
                Who wanted me dead? <br>
                Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed? <br>
                Were you writing a book? <br>
                Were you a sleeper cell spy? <br>
                In fifty years will all this be declassified? <br>
                And you'll confess why you did it <br>
                And I'll say, "Good riddance" <br>
                'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden <br>
                I would've died for your sins <br>
                Instead I just died inside <br>
                And you deserve prison, but you won't get time <br>
                You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars <br>
                You crashed my party and your rental car <br>
                You said normal girls were "boring" <br>
                But you were gone by the morning <br>
                You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing
            </p>
            <p>
                And in plain sight you hid <br>
                But you are what you did <br>
                And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive <br>
                The smallest man who ever lived

                There are a few reasons I chose this song. The main one is simply because I like to listen to it
                and remember how much fun it was to scream at The Eras Tour. I also like the entire album and how 
                angry it feels, since I am also often angry so it feels nice to listen to when I need to let out my
                feelings.
